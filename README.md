# Michaels-Portfolio


## Description

A well-structured portfolio serves as a powerful tool for potential employers, whether you're seeking part-time or full-time positions. An effective portfolio not only showcases my best work but also provides insights into my creative and problem-solving processes. Having multiple live projects is often a prerequisite for securing an initial interview at many companies. With these considerations in mind, this challenge was an opportunity to apply the fundamental skills I've recently acquired, such as flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. I've not only gained hands-on experience but also created a valuable asset to aid in my future job search.
